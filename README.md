## Project Overview

This project utilizes the dataset titled "Crowdsourced Smarthome Requirements with Creativity Ratings." The dataset was analyzed in the paper "Crowdsourcing Requirements: Does Teamwork Enhance Crowd Creativity?"

The dataset consists of the following CSV files:

1. **presurvey-questions**: A list of presurvey questions used to collect demographic information.
2. **disc-questions**: A list of DISC personality questions designed to assess a crowd worker’s personality. Each group contains a set of four statements from which the worker was expected to select one.
3. **post-survey-questions**: A list of postsurvey questions.
4. **users**: A list of crowd workers who participated in the study. Values 1 and 2 in the column ‘group_type’ correspond to workers in solo and interacting teams, respectively.
5. **presurvey-responses**: The responses of workers to the presurvey.
6. **personality_data**: Workers' IPIP scores (O, C, E, A, N metrics) and DISC (both raw and normalized) scores.
7. **post-survey-responses**: The responses of workers to the postsurvey.
8. **all_requirements**: Requirements elicited by the crowd workers in a user story format.
9. **creativity-ratings.csv**: Authors’ average ratings for each requirement based on the metrics ‘detailedness,’ ‘novelty,’ and ‘usefulness.’
