## Project Overview
This dataset contains the data analyzed in the paper titled "Crowdsourcing Requirements: Does Teamwork Enhance Crowd Creativity?"

The dataset contains the following csv files:

1. presurvey-questions: List of presurvey questions to collect demographics

2. disc-questions: List of DISC personality questions to cause a crowd worker’s personality. Each group has a set of 4 statements out of which the worker was expected to select one

3. post-survey-questions: List of postsurvey questions

4. users: List of crowd workers in the study; values 1 and 2 of the column ‘group_type’ correspond to workers in solo and interacting teams respectively

5. presurvey-responses: Workers' responses to the presurvey

6. personality_data: Workers’ IPIP (O, C, E, A, N metrics) and DISC (raw and normalized) scores

7. post-survey-responses: Workers' responses to the postsurvey

8. all_requirements: Requirements in a user story format, elicited by the crowd workers

9. creativity-ratings.csv: Authors’ average ratings for each requirement for the metrics ‘detailedness’, ‘novelty’ and ‘usefulness’
